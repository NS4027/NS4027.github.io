      <p>This Personal Project gave me an overall positive experience.  This project teached me a lot about self control, time management and planning ahead.  At the start of this project, a lot of people including me feel like we have a lot of time to do the report and product.  But as weeks and weeks pass, I started to realize that I can not procrastinate as lots of things could go wrong when making my product.  Some things did end up being messed up during the creation of my product which resulted in me having to rush the product and report.  I feel like I demonstrated IB learner profile risk taker and knowledgeable during this project.  I took the risk and tried to make a youtube video worthy video like those seen on youtube.  However I severely miscalculated the difficulty of doing so and the time it needed.  I tried to make a good product but ended up with a product that I am still satisfied with but I know that I would be able to make a better product than the current one if I was to use the time wisely.  I also demonstrated an IB learner profile knowledgeable because I learned and knew a lot about aviation as a whole which is one key takeaway I had planned when thinking about my topic for this project. </p>

      <p>I have went to countless countries and cities in my life time.  Ranging from Taipei to Vancouver, I have always felt the flying part of the trip the best part.  Something about the check-in, boarding the plane and the journey to the destination is thrilling for me.  </p>
